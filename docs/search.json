While wind has a negative correlation with ozone of -0.6124966, temperature had the slightly stronger correlation, and thus I thought it would be best to use when running this model.\nWhen running summary() to preview the model, we can see information such as the intercepts, standard errors, and predicted temperatures.\nThe p-value of the dataset is &lt; 2.2e-16. P-values indicate the likelihood of rejecting the null hypothesis, and the smaller the p-value, the higher the likelihood of rejecting the null. In this dataset, this means it is unlikely that the two variables donâ€™t have a tangible correlation\nThe F-statistic is 103.9. High f-statistics indicate that there is more variation between groups than within groups. This means that the differences between the baseline model and the model with temperature included are unlikely to be caused by chance.\nThe R^2 value of 0.488 suggests that 48.8% of the variation observed in Ozone levels can be explained by temperature. This is a moderate R^2 predictor. There are other important factors that influence Ozone, but temperature is still a strong predicting factor.\nThe residual standard error (RSE) is 23.92, meaning that the actual Ozone values tend to deviate from the predicted values by about 24 ppb on average.\nIn conclusion, the model does seem like a valid model. Its moderate R^2 and high residuals suggest that there are definitely other factors playing a role in predicting Ozone, but this is definitely a good start to predicting Ozone values."

While this is a moderate value, it still suggests that temperature has a noticeable effect on ozone. The remaining 51.2% of variation is influenced by other factors not included in the model, which could include variables like wind, solar radiation, or other atmospheric conditions."
